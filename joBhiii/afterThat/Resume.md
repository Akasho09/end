## Pros :
1. College-Based Database Management System
- Built a complete `MERN` application to assist college administration in managing attendance, internal marks, schedules, and student details.
- Backend: Built an Express.js API for communication with the MongoDB database.
- Functionality: Enabled staff to perform CRUD operations for attendance, internal marks, and schedule management.
- Impact: Enhanced data management efficiency and improved institutional workflow.

2. MediumPro - Blogging Web App
- Built with React focusing on reusable, maintainable UI components.
- Implemented Zod for type-safe form validation and schema enforcement.
- Used debouncing to optimize API calls and improve user experience during fast typing or repeated actions.

- used Hono framework and developed with Cloudflare Workers, enabling a serverless, globally distributed, edge-fast backend.

- Used Prisma ORM with type safety, schema migrations, and connection pooling for scalable database operations.
- Implemented secure JWT authentication, with tokens stored in cookies to enhance safety and prevent localStorage vulnerabilities.

3. DriftPro - Paytm for Desktop

• Feature: Developed a secure, payment-like desktop application with seamless transaction handling.

• Framework: Built using Next.js for both frontend and backend logic.

• Backend: Used Express.js as an auxiliary service for specialized operations.

• Architecture: Implemented a monorepo setup with Turborepo for scalability and performance.

• Database: Stored transaction data securely using PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM.

• UI: Designed an intuitive interface using Tailwind CSS.
