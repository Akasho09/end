// Q5) You are given a string A and you have to find the number of different sub-strings of the string A which are fake palindromes. 

// Note: 

// 1. Palindrome: A string is called a palindrome if you reverse the string yet the order of letters remains the same. For example, MADAM. 

// 2. Fake Palindrome: A string is called as a fake palindrome if any of its permutations is a palindrome. For example, AAC is fake palindrome, but ACD is not. 

// 3. Sub-string: A sub-string is a contiguous sequence (non-empty) of characters within a string. 

// 4. Two sub-strings are considered same if their starting indices and ending indices are equal.
