## System calls
- A system call is a mechanism that allows a program running in user mode to switch to kernel mode and request a service from the OS kernel.

| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Process Control**         | `fork()`, `exec()`, `exit()`, `wait()`              | Create, terminate, or manage processes       |
| **File Management**         | `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()`, `lseek()` | Manage files and directories                 |
| **Device Management**       | `ioctl()`, `read()`, `write()`                      | Request or release device access             |
| **Information Maintenance** | `getpid()`, `alarm()`, `sleep()`, `gettimeofday()`  | Get or set system data                       |
| **Communication**           | `pipe()`, `shmget()`, `send()`, `recv()`            | Facilitate inter-process communication (IPC) |

- Process
A process is a program in execution.
It is more than just the program code ‚Äî it includes the current activity, resources, and state required to run the program.

| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Program code**                | Also called the text segment ‚Äî the instructions to execute    |
| **Program counter (PC)**        | Keeps track of the next instruction to execute                |
| **CPU registers**               | Temporary storage for calculations and data                   |
| **Stack**                       | Stores function calls, local variables, return addresses      |
| **Heap**                        | Dynamically allocated memory during execution                 |
| **Data segment**                | Global/static variables                                       |
| **Process control block (PCB)** | OS data structure storing PID, state, priority, and resources |

Parent: bash syCalls.sh
Child: sleep 1 (created ‚Üí sleeps ‚Üí exits ‚Üí replaced by a new one)

## How Operating System Boots up?
Booting is the process of starting a computer and loading the operating system into the main memory (RAM) from storage.

‚öôÔ∏è Steps of OS Booting
1. Power-On & POST (Power-On Self-Test)
- When you press the power button:
    - The power supply turns on the CPU, memory, and peripherals.
    - The BIOS/UEFI firmware runs the POST to check hardware like RAM, CPU, keyboard, etc.
- If a problem is found ‚Üí error beep codes or messages.

2. BIOS/UEFI Initialization
- BIOS/UEFI is firmware stored on a chip on the motherboard.
- It initializes hardware and sets up a minimal environment.
- Locates the bootable device (HDD, SSD, USB).

3. Bootloader Execution
- BIOS/UEFI loads the bootloader from the boot sector of the boot device.
- Common bootloaders: GRUB (Linux), Windows Boot Manager.
- The bootloader is a small program that loads the OS kernel into memory.

4. Loading the OS Kernel
- The kernel (core part of OS) is loaded into RAM.
- Kernel initializes:
    - Memory management
    - Process scheduler
    - Device drivers
    - File system

5. Initial System Processes
- The kernel starts the first system process:
    - Linux ‚Üí init or systemd
    - Windows ‚Üí smss.exe, wininit.exe
- This process starts other system services, background processes, and prepares the system for user interaction.

## CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) 
- is a small memory chip on the motherboard that stores system hardware settings, like:
    - Date and time
    - Boot order
    - Hardware configuration (CPU, RAM, drives)
    - Passwords and system options
- It works even when the computer is turned off, thanks to a small CMOS battery.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Points About CMOS
- Stores BIOS/UEFI Settings
    - CMOS holds the configuration settings for the BIOS or UEFI firmware.
- Volatile Memory
    - CMOS memory is volatile, meaning it loses data if the battery dies.
- Powered by CMOS Battery
    - Usually a small coin-cell battery (like CR2032) on the motherboard keeps it alive when the PC is off.
- Adjustable via BIOS/UEFI
    - Users can change settings like boot order, system clock, enabling/disabling devices, etc.


## üß© Difference Between 32-bit and 64-bit Operating Systems
- The terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to how a computer‚Äôs CPU (Central Processing Unit) handles information.
- A 64-bit OS can process and store data in 64-bit chunks, while a 32-bit OS can handle only 32-bit chunks at a time.
