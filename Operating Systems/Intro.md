| Feature           | System Software                                                                                          | Operating System (OS)                                                                                                |

| **Definition**    | A set of programs that manage computer hardware and provide a platform for running application software. | A type of system software that acts as an intermediary between hardware and the user/applications.                   |
| **Purpose**       | To manage hardware resources and provide services to application software.                               | To control and coordinate hardware, manage files, processes, memory, and provide a user interface.                   |
| **Examples**      | Operating systems, device drivers, utility programs, compilers, assemblers.                              | Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS.                                                                                 |
| **Scope**         | Broad category that includes OS and other system-level software.                                         | A specific component of system software.                                                                             |
| **Functionality** | Provides basic functions like file management, hardware control, and program execution environment.      | Provides core functions like process management, memory management, device management, security, and user interface. |

> OS works on top os System software , to manage resouces/hardware for different user/applications .

# An operating system  : 
is a piece of software that manages all the resources of a computer system,both hardware and software, and provides an environment in which the user can execute his/her programs in a convenient and efficient manner by hiding underlying complexity of the hardware and acting as a resource manager.

> Device Driver = A special type of system software that allows the operating system (OS) to communicate with hardware devices.

## Why OS?
1. Bulky and complex app. (Hardware interaction code must be in appâ€™s code base)
2. Resource exploitation by 1 App.
3. No memory protection.

## what is an OS made up of?
 - Collection of system software.

## Hierarchy :
- User
- Application programs
- Operating system
- Computer hardware

## OS Functions :
An operating system function -
- Access to the computer hardware.
- interface between the user and the computer hardware
- Resource management (Aka, Arbitration) (memory, device, file, security, process etc)
- Hides the underlying complexity of the hardware. (Aka, Abstraction)
- facilitates execution of application programs by providing isolation and protection.
